Becoming a biomedical data scientist: My career aspiration.
My long term professional goal is to improve disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes using genomic analysis and machine languages.
To achieve this, I intend to further advance my educational knowledge by undergoing a masters degree in biomedical data science and a phd program in public health with focus on biostatistics and epidemology, PhD in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Biomedicine or precision medicine.
In my pursuit to this great accomplishment, I need to Master machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), cloud computing (AWS, Azure), and data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI), gain research experience by collaborating with researchers, publish papers in reputable journals, and present at conferences (ASHG, RECOMB). Through Industry Networking, I hope to Connect with professionals at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies (Illumina, Biogen)
I am currently skilled in three Programming languages: Python, R, SQL.
Follow me for updates on my biomedical data science journey!
